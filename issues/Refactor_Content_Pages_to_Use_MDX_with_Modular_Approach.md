### Summary
Convert all free-text content pages into MDX format while maintaining a modular approach for structured components.

### Scope
1. Refactor all pages to ensure MDX is used for free-text content, leaving structured data in reusable JSX components.
2. Modularize the home page by isolating free-text content into MDX, while keeping reusable components for structured sections.
3. Create reusable components (e.g., buttons, cards, hero sections) to simplify MDX usage.
4. No CMS integration is planned at this stage.
5. Use a dedicated feature branch for this refactor.

### Expected Outcomes
- All pages will have their free-text content in MDX for easy editing.
- Structured components remain modular and reusable.
- A consistent and user-friendly workflow for editing MDX files.
