## Rules and Guidelines

1. This year we have 3 kinds of challenges:
   * Remote challenges
   * Local challenges (on site)
   * "0 knowledge" treasure hunt challenges (on site) – juniors this is for you!

2. We only allow physically present teams to claim a prize, make sure a member of your team is in the announcement ceremony!

3. We will contact winners using the email registered at the CTF Website. Use an email you monitor.

4. This is a game, play fairly - we reserve the right to disqualify participants (and we came pretty close to do that in the past)

5. Each team may be made of one or more individuals.

6. The winning team will get a collective prize which will be shared between the team participants.

> We usually keep the challenges alive for a couple more days after the event to enable write-ups
